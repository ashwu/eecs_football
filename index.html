    <h1>THE EVOLUTION OF FOOTBALL GEAR</h1>
  </div>

  <div id="intro">
    <p class="info"> 
      Professional football started in the 1892, developed from traditional rugby. And as much as the sport itself has changed through the decades, the gear and equipment have evolved significantly as well. With both professional and intercollegiate football playoffs kicking in, it never hurts to know a few fun facts about the sport to add to the typical conversations. By Ashley Wu.

    <p id="blurb"> <b>THE FIELD:</b> <br> A football field is 120 yards long and over 53 yards wide. The field doesn't need to be perfectly flat to accomodate rolls or bounces of the ball. It mainly functions as a way to show the process of the competition. And of course, to cushion the tackles.</p>

      <h2>Early 1800s: "PIGSKINS"</h2>
      <img src="images/pigskin.png" class="timeline-icon">
      <p class="timeline-info">
        Before early football evolved from rugby, pig bladders were inflated and used to make rugby balls. They were easy to obtain and sturdy enough to be thrown around. Inventor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(rugby)">William Gilbert</a>, manufacturer of sporting goods, was the first to do this. Pig bladders were no longer as commonly used after the late 19th century as the popularity of intercollegiate football rose.

      <img src="images/rubberball.png" class="timeline-icon">
      <p class="timeline-info">
        During this time, people began making footballs with rubber and cowhide after the invention of vulcanized rubber by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a> back in 1839. This eliminated the disgusting task of inflating a pig's bladder, which often had to be done multiple times throughout a game.

      <p class="timeline-info">
        This year, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddell">Ridell Company</a> based in Chicago, Illinois started making helmets out of plastic because it felt that it would be safer, lighter, stronger and more long lasting than leather. Plastic held its shape during collisions on the field. These helmest were more comfortable with padding to cushion the head during impact. There were also plastic face masks and a chin strap included, protecting more of the head.

      <p class="timeline-info">
        In the 1940s, the NFL required helmets on the field and almost every professional football player wore a plastic helmet by the 1950s. The last player to play without a helmet was <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24366564/remember-when-dick-plasman-was-last-player-to-forgo-a-helmet">Dick Plasman</a>, a running back for the Chicago Bears, in the 1940 NFL Championship game between the Bears and the Washington Redskins. Now, helmets have updated shock absorbers, padding, guards and pieces to protect the player from skull and brain damage.

        The first helmet was said to have been invented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Barclay_(sportsperson)" target="_blank">George Barclay</a>, a professional baseball and football player. It was constructed with three leather straps attached together to protect the ears and prevent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower_ear" target="_blank">cauliflower ears</a>. As expected, this version of the helmet didn't do much to prevent concussions or other head damage.

        Around this time, helmets were made of padded leather and resembled aviators' helmets. In 1917, helmets were raised above the head to direct blows away from the head and allow for ventilation. These helmets still lacked face masks which didn't help prevent injuries. In addition, these helmets were uncomfortable because they absorbed a lot of heat. Starting in the 1920s, helmets were widely used in football for the first time.
