        The first helmet was said to have been invented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Barclay_(sportsperson)">George Barclay</a>, <br>a professional baseball and football player. It was constructed with three leather straps attached together to protect the ears and prevent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower_ear">cauliflower ears</a>. As expected, this version of the helmet didn't do much to prevent concussions or other head damage.

      <h2>1915 - 1917</h2>

      <p class="timeline-info">
        Around this time, helmets were made of padded leather and resembled aviators' helmets. In 1917, helmets were raised above the head to direct blows away from the head and allow for ventilation. These helmets still lacked face masks which didn't help prevent injuries. In addition, these helmets were uncomfortable because they absorbed a lot of heat. Starting in the 1920s, helmets were widely used in football for the first time.

      <p class="timeline-info">
        This year, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddell">Ridell Company</a> based in Chicago, Illinois started making helmets out of plastic because it felt that it would be safer, lighter, stronger and more long lasting than leather. Plastic held its shape during collisions on the field. These helmest were more comfortable with padding to cushion the head during impact. There were also plastic face masks and a chin strap included, protecting more of the head.

      <h2>1940s - NOW</h2>

      <p class="timeline-info">
        In the 1940s, the NFL required helmets on the field and almost every professional football player wore a plastic helmet by the 1950s. The last player to play without a helmet was <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24366564/remember-when-dick-plasman-was-last-player-to-forgo-a-helmet">Dick Plasman</a>, a running back for the Chicago Bears, in the 1940 NFL Championship game between the Bears and the Washington Redskins. Now, helmets have updated shock absorbers, padding, guards and pieces to protect the player from skull and brain damage.
